# Nucleus
Uses Detectron2 to detect single nuclei in crowded immunofluorescence images.

## Data used
This table shows the main datasets used to train and validate detectron. These are available at XXXXXXXXXX.





## How to
To detect nuclei in your own image of interest just follow the notebook XXXXXXXXXX. 

Please note:

1) 40-60X objectives
2) DAPI stains
3) Size of image should be a multiple of 256 (256, 512, 1024, 2084, ...)


If you crop your image to a 256x256 pixels square, these some typical images the network is used to predict:
